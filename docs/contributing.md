### Developing <a href="#developing" id="developing"></a>

If you already cloned [ProtoPY](https://github.com/FrahHS/protopy) and you want to give your contribute to the code, here are some guidelines to set up your environment.

#### Install requirements using pip <a href="#install-requirements-using-pip" id="install-requirements-using-pip"></a>

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Format the code <a href="#format-the-code" id="format-the-code"></a>

There is a script that you can run that will format and clean all your code (you must do it):

```bash
bash scripts/format.sh
```
